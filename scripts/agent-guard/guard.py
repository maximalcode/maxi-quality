"""Shared machinery for the three agent-guard hooks.

WHY A FINGERPRINT AND NOT A RE-RUN

The `Stop` hook has to answer "has this repo's gate run against the code the
session is about to call done?". The obvious implementation is to run the gate
inside the hook. That was rejected: Layer 1 on a multi-language monorepo is
minutes, the hook runs on EVERY stop, and a guard that costs minutes per stop
is a guard someone deletes. So the hook answers the question from a receipt —
a recorded verdict plus a fingerprint of exactly what was verified — and the
comparison is a hash, not a toolchain.

WHAT THE FINGERPRINT COVERS

The content of every file that differs from HEAD: tracked modifications,
staged changes, and untracked files git would not ignore. Renames and
deletions move it. A file the gate never saw cannot be inside a receipt that
matches, which is the only property the Stop hook needs.

It deliberately does NOT cover HEAD itself. Committing does not invalidate a
receipt for content that did not change, and rebasing onto new upstream work
does not either — the gate ran on these changes, and CI is what gates the
merge. A receipt is a statement about a diff, not about a commit.

THIS GUARDS DRIFT, NOT MALICE

The `permissions.deny` half of this contract stops the FILE TOOLS writing the
receipt; a shell still can, and the receipt is this hook's own input, so a
hand-written one with a matching fingerprint passes and there is no backstop
that could catch it. None of this is hardened against that and it does not
need to be: the failure it exists to stop is a model that forgets, not a model
that lies. Saying so plainly matters, because a guard sold as tamper-proof
gets trusted for things it cannot do. configs/agent/README.md §3 states the
boundary in full.

FAIL OPEN ON OUR OWN PLUMBING, FAIL CLOSED ON POLICY

`hooks/pre-commit` has the same rule and states the same reason: a guard that
blocks on its own broken plumbing teaches people to switch it off, and then it
is not catching the real thing either. There is one difference here and it is
the reason this file exists rather than a shell one-liner: an agent hook is
NOT bypassable by the party it constrains. The model cannot pass `--no-verify`.
So a plumbing failure — no git, unreadable receipt, malformed stdin — must
exit 0 with a warning, or a broken install becomes a session nobody can end.
A policy failure — the gate did not run, the fixture was weakened — exits 2.

WHAT FAIL-OPEN DOES NOT COVER

It covers a script that RUNS and fails. It cannot cover a script that is not
there: a `settings.json` naming a missing file fails at exec, before any of
this module is imported, and Claude Code treats a PreToolUse hook error as
blocking. Every Bash, Write and Edit call in the repo then fails, and a session
inside it cannot repair itself — observed, and it reached a consumer's default
branch (#196). The guarantee is real and it has an edge, and stating it without
the edge is how the edge gets found the hard way. `adopt.sh` closes it with a
post-condition: after any --agent run, every command it wrote names a file that
exists.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (#167)

    The milestone wants four integers from LIVING with the contract: sessions
    run, stops blocked, blocks that were correct, blocks that were wrong. Until
    this, the guard blocked and forgot, so those numbers could only ever come
    from someone remembering them — which is the discipline-instead-of-mechanism
    failure this whole contract exists to replace. A measurement you have to
    remember is a measurement that does not happen.

    WHAT IT MAY CONTAIN, WHICH IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART

    A reason CODE and counts. Never a path, a command, a branch, a filename or
    any text from the tree. The consuming repos are private and nothing from
    them reaches the baseline (CLAUDE.md §2), so the summary of this file has to
    be safe to paste into a public issue by construction rather than by someone
    reading it carefully first. `selftest.py` asserts the key set for that
    reason: a field added later that carries content would be a leak nobody
    would notice at the moment it was written.

    FAIL OPEN, HARDER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HERE

    Every exception is swallowed. A guard that refused a stop because it could
    not write its own bookkeeping would be a measurement instrument that changes
    what it measures, and the thing being measured is how often this gets in the
    way. The ledger is worth having and it is worth nothing next to the
    decision.

    was the first name and it read as "at least the gate", which is a promise
    the body does not make.

    THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR (#178)

    A fingerprint cannot see it. `a && b` run as half a gate produces a receipt
    that is genuinely fresh and genuinely passing — for content that a check
    genuinely read. What it does not record is `b`. So the receipt is checked
    against WHAT RAN as well as against what was verified.

    Two shapes are accepted, and they are the two ways the declared gate
    actually gets run rather than a generosity budget:

      * `--gate`, which records the declared string in its own field;
      * an argv that is either this module's own `bash -c` rendering of the
        declaration — what `--gate` executes, and the pre-#178 workaround — or
        the declaration parsed as an argv, which is how a one-command gate has
        always been run and must keep working.

    THE COMPARISON IS ON ARGVS, NOT ON STRINGS, and that is not tidiness. The
    receipt stores a joined line, so comparing text would make
    `bash -c "a && b"` and `bash -c 'a && b'` different gates — two spellings
    of one command, one of which would then be refused forever with a message
    saying it is not the declared gate. Splitting both sides normalises the
    quoting away, and `SHELL_OPERATORS` is what stops that normalisation from
    also erasing the difference between `a && b` and an argv of three words.

    Both inputs are session-writable — the declaration and the receipt field
    alike — so narrowing the declaration to match a half-run passes this. That
    is the boundary this module's header already states in full: it guards
    drift, not malice, and pretending otherwise is how a guard gets trusted for
    something it cannot do.
