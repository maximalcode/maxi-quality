"""`PreToolUse` hook on `Bash`: refuse a commit or push that skips the hooks.

WHAT IT ENFORCES

`adopt.sh --hooks` installs `hooks/pre-commit`, and that hook is the last
thing between a working tree and a commit the gate never saw. It is also
switched off by seven characters. `git commit --no-verify` is not a hostile
act — it is what a session reaches for when a commit is refused and the
refusal looks like plumbing — and it turns the local half of this baseline
off silently. So: the flag is refused, on `commit` and on `push`, and the
refusal says which gate it is protecting.

WHY A HOOK AND NOT A `permissions.deny` RULE

The other half of this contract IS a deny rule, so the asymmetry is worth
stating. Two facts from the permissions reference (read 2026-08-23) rule it
out here:

  * `Bash(command:...)` is not a usable rule. The docs: a rule like
    `Bash(command:rm *)` "would be bypassable by a compound command, so
    Claude Code ignores it and emits a startup warning." A rule that is
    accepted, never consulted, and warns once at startup is indistinguishable
    from protection.
  * `Bash(git commit --no-verify *)` is the prefix form, and the docs devote a
    warning to how fragile argument-matching is: options before the argument,
    variables, extra spaces. Every bypass in that list applies here.

Their recommended answer to both is this file: "use PreToolUse hooks". So the
tokenizer below is the thing under test, and `samples/agent-guard/` tests it
as one — including the two shapes a substring search gets backwards, a flag
inside a commit MESSAGE and a flag on the far side of an `&&`.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM

It reads the command Claude asked to run. It does not read what that command
then does: a shell script, a `Makefile` target or an alias that itself commits
with `--no-verify` passes this hook, because the flag is not in the text. That
is the same boundary `sample-guard.py` has and it is the same answer — this
guards drift, not malice. `hooks/pre-commit` is not a security control and
this is not one either.

AND IT FAILS OPEN ON ITS OWN PLUMBING

A command the tokenizer cannot read — an unbalanced quote — allows and warns.
An agent hook is not bypassable by the party it constrains, so a parser that
refuses what it cannot parse turns every odd command into a wall.
